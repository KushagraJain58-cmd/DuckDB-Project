# DuckDB-Project

### DuckDB’s capabilities by performing basic queries or analytics.
By working on this project and reading **documentations** about DuckDB I found that:
- DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database that is optimized for analytics workloads. While it is a very powerful tool for performing queries and analytics directly within your application.
- An **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing) database is a type of database designed for efficiently handling complex queries often required in analytical processing. Unlike traditional **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing) databases, which are optimized for managing day-to-day transactions (such as inserting, updating, and deleting records), OLAP databases are optimized for querying large amounts of data, particularly for decision support and business intelligence.
- It's features and capabilities:
    1. In-memory execution: DuckDB is an in-process database that can perform queries entirely in-memory, which leads to faster analytics, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here I used my_database.duckdb.
    2. SQL support: DuckDB supports standard SQL, and it has good support for advanced analytical functions like window functions, joins, and complex aggregations.
    3. Lightweight and embeddable: It’s embedded in the application, meaning it can run directly within your service without external server
    4. Column storage: It uses column storage, optimized for analytical queries that require aggregating, filtering, and scanning large amounts of data.
 
### DuckDB’s performance and features with other databases
- **PostgreSQL** is slightly slower for complex analytics (especially with larger datasets) compared to DuckDB, more setup overhead (not in-process). Although PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database with robust support for complex SQL queries, scalability, and extensibility.
- **MySQL** is another popular relational database but is primarily optimized for transactional workloads (OLTP). While it supports SQL, it is not designed for heavy analytics or complex queries on large datasets as DuckDB is.
- **BigQuery** is a cloud-native OLAP databases are designed for large-scale analytics and can handle extremely high workloads. They are highly performant but are typically cloud-based, which adds operational complexity.

### Should we use DuckDB for building a Text-to-SQL API?
- A Text-to-SQL API would typically involve parsing natural language queries, converting them into SQL, and executing those SQL queries on the database.
- In my experience DuckDB excels in executing analytical queries very quickly, especially when working with large datasets, thanks to its columnar storage and in-memory processing. However, for real-time transactional workloads (OLTP), other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL may be more suitable.
- We should use DuckDB if you’re building a Text-to-SQL API for analytical workloads where the queries mostly involve complex aggregations, joins, and filtering of large datasets.

### My experience
- While working with DuckDB in Node.js, I noticed a lack of comprehensive documentation and references compared to MongoDB and MySQL. This suggests that DuckDB's use case with Node.js is less common. Basic operations were more challenging to implement since, in Node.js, we typically handle data in JSON format and as objects for frontend use. Extracting data as an array of objects required writing significantly more code compared to the straightforward approach used with MongoDB.
